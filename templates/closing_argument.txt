\section*{Closing Argument}

    I think that you should do this trade because Player A is not helping your team by sitting on the bench. Meanwhile you have that real stinker of a WR Player B stuck in your Flex spot, whereas I could get value out of Player A, and send you Player C so that you don't have to start Player B. 

    That sounds like a win-win to me. Let me know what you think, and good luck this week against Other Owner.
