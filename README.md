This script generates a trade request sheet with some basic statistics intended to provide a general picture of the players involved in the trade. The respository contains one example from the 2014 season.

Output can be customized in terms of league scoring rules in the same file in which the players involved in the trades are inputted (./trade_parameters.py).

It is dependent on BurntSushi's very nice nfl stats repository nflgame, which can be found at https://github.com/BurntSushi/nflgame

It also currently creates output as a LaTeX file, so some knowledge of LaTeX is necessary to get the final pdf. If you do not currently have a LaTeX installation, then you can use the content of result.tex over at sharelatex.com.
