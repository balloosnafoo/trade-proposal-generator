This script generates a trade request sheet with some basic statistics intended to provide a general picture of the players involved in the trade. The respository contains one example from the 2014 season.

Output can be customized in terms of league scoring rules in the same file in which the players involved in the trades are inputted (./trade_parameters.py).

It is dependent on BurntSushi's nice nfl stats repository nflgame, which is on github.
